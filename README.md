## Fall AI Studio Project Overview

### Project Overview
The **BERT Model Text Classification** project applies **BERT** (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for text classification, enabling high accuracy for tasks like sentiment analysis and document categorization. As the **project lead**, I guided the team through model training, optimization, and evaluation to achieve impactful results.

### Objectives and Goals:
- **Objective 1**: Create dataset from scratch and perform sentiment analysis and intent detection.
- **Objective 2**: Train and fine-tune the BERT model for text classification. 
- **Objective 3**: Create a deployable model for use in production environments.

### Methodology:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and tokenize text data using BERT's tokenization methods.
- **Model Development**: Fine-tune BERT for the classification task.
- **Evaluation**: Use performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

### Results and Key Findings:
- The model demonstrated accurate sentiment and intent prediction.
- Further improvements can be made by experimenting with different fine-tuning strategies and expanding the dataset.

### Visualizations:

### Potential Next Steps:
- Integrate the model into an API for easy access and use in other applications.
- Expand the dataset for improved generalization and performance.

### Individual Contributions:
- Led the project, including managing tasks, overseeing data preprocessing, and optimizing the BERT model.
